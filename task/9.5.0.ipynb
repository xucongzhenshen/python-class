    "## Steps to Complete\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Impossible Chord**  \n",
    "   - Identify the three constituent notes: C0, C4, and C8.  \n",
    "   - Research and record their frequencies (use the `get_note_frequencies()` function for accuracy).  \n",
    "   - Explain *why* this combination is impossible:  \n",
    "     - Physical limitations of human hands and instruments  \n",
    "     - Perceptual challenges with extreme frequencies  \n",
    "     - Instrument range constraints  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Individual Note Signals**  \n",
    "   - Use a 2-second duration and standard sample rate.  \n",
    "   - Create an ADSR envelope for each note (attack=0.05s, decay=0.2s, sustain_level=0.7, release=0.5s) to simulate natural instrument behavior.  \n",
    "   - Generate signals for each note using a piano timbre (via `generate_timbre()`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine the Notes Safely**  \n",
    "   - Use dynamic mixing to combine C4 (as the \"melody\") with C0 + C8 (as the \"chord\") to avoid clipping.  \n",
    "   - Apply a 0.3-second fadeout to eliminate clicks at the end of the signal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualize the Time Domain**  \n",
    "   - Plot a 0.1-second segment of the combined chord.  \n",
    "   - Describe the waveform: How do the three frequencies interact visually? Why is the waveform more complex than a single note?  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analyze Frequency Components**  \n",
    "   - Perform an FFT to identify the dominant frequencies in the chord.  \n",
    "   - Generate a spectrogram to visualize how frequency content changes over time.  \n",
    "   - Verify that all three target frequencies (C0, C4, C8) appear in the analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluate Perception**  \n",
    "   - Play the synthesized chord.  \n",
    "   - Describe what you hear: Which notes are most/least prominent? Why?  \n",
    "   - Connect your observations to the physical limitations of human hearing (e.g., sensitivity to mid-range frequencies vs. extreme lows/highs).  "

    "- Accuracy of signal generation (correct frequencies, envelopes, and mixing).  \n",
    "- Quality of visualizations (clarity, proper labeling, relevant time/frequency ranges).  \n",
    "- Depth of analysis (ability to connect technical properties to musical/physical limitations).  \n",
    "- Correct use of audio processing functions (envelopes, mixing, fadeouts).  \n",
