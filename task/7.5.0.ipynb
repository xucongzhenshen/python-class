    "1. **Generate Musical Notes & Frequencies**:  \n",
    "   - Include all 12 notes in an octave (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B) across octaves 1 to 8 (e.g., C1 to B8).  \n",
    "   - Calculate their frequencies using the `librosa.note_to_hz()` function (ensure you install `librosa` first: `pip install librosa`).  \n",
    "   - Filter notes to only include those within the human audible range (20 Hz to 20,000 Hz).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualization Specifications**:  \n",
    "   - Create a plot where:  \n",
    "     - The x-axis shows note names in SPN (e.g., C4, D#5).  \n",
    "     - The y-axis shows frequency in Hz (use a linear scale).  \n",
    "   - Use vertical lines to represent each note’s frequency (from y=0 to the note’s frequency).  \n",
    "   - Add markers (e.g., circles) at the top of each vertical line to highlight the frequency value.  \n",
    "   - Color-code lines/markers by octave (e.g., all octave 4 notes share a color).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Reference Annotations**:  \n",
    "   - Add horizontal lines and labels for:  \n",
    "     - The lower limit of human hearing (20 Hz).  \n",
    "     - The upper limit of human hearing (20,000 Hz).  \n",
    "     - Concert pitch (A4 = 440 Hz) – use a distinct color (e.g., red) for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Formatting & Readability**:  \n",
    "   - Include a title (e.g., \"Musical Notes in the Audible Range (20–20,000 Hz)\").  \n",
    "   - Label the x-axis (\"Musical Note (Scientific Pitch Notation)\") and y-axis (\"Frequency (Hz)\").  \n",
    "   - Rotate x-axis labels for readability (since there are many notes).  \n",
    "   - Add a legend that maps colors to octaves (e.g., \"Octave 1\", \"Octave 2\", etc.).  \n",
    "   - Adjust the plot layout to prevent clipping (e.g., use `subplots_adjust()` to add padding).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**  \n",
    "- A single Python script (`.py` file) with all code written from scratch (no copying/pasting from external sources).  \n",
    "- The script must be self-contained (include comments explaining key steps).  \n",
    "- When run, it should display a clear, labeled plot meeting all specifications.  "
