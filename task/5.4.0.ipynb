    "# <a id='toc3_'></a>[Core Requirements](#toc0_)\n",
    "Your code must include the following 5 key steps (structure your code with clear markdown headings for each step, as in the example):  \n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc3_1_'></a>[**Import Libraries**](#toc0_)\n",
    "   Import all necessary libraries: `cv2` (OpenCV) for video/frame processing, `numpy` for numerical calculations, `matplotlib.pyplot` + `matplotlib.animation` for plotting/animation, `IPython.display.HTML` for animation display, `os` for file size calculation, and `time` for progress tracking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc3_2_'></a>[**Load Video & Extract Frames**](#toc0_)\n",
    "   - Load a wingsuit video (use the path `Video/Wingsuit.mp4`; assume the `Video` folder exists in your working directory).  \n",
    "   - Extract key video properties: file size (convert to MB), dimensions (width×height), total frames, FPS, duration (seconds/minutes), and codec (decode `cv2.CAP_PROP_FOURCC` to a readable string).  \n",
    "   - Extract up to 90 frames (or all frames if the video has fewer than 90) — store both original color frames and grayscale frames (required for optical flow).  \n",
    "   - Release the video capture object after extraction, print the number of extracted frames, and display the first frame (convert BGR to RGB for correct Matplotlib rendering).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc3_3_'></a>[**Dynamic Motion Tracking with Optical Flow**](#toc0_)\n",
    "   - Define parameters for feature detection (`cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack`): set `maxCorners=200`, `qualityLevel=0.01`, `minDistance=10`, `blockSize=15`.  \n",
    "   - Define parameters for Lucas-Kanade optical flow: `winSize=(25,25)`, `maxLevel=5`, `criteria=(cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_EPS | cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_COUNT, 30, 0.01)`.  \n",
    "   - Track features across frames with **dynamic feature refresh**:  \n",
    "     - Start by detecting initial features from the first grayscale frame.  \n",
    "     - For each subsequent frame, calculate optical flow to track features.  \n",
    "     - If fewer than 50 valid features remain *or* every 5 frames (refresh interval), detect new features and combine them with valid existing ones (limit to 200 total features).  \n",
    "   - Draw color-coded motion vectors:  \n",
    "     - Calculate speed for each feature (Euclidean distance between old/new positions).  \n",
    "     - Use color rules: blue (speed < 5), green (5 ≤ speed < 15), red (speed ≥ 15).  \n",
    "     - Draw arrows with `cv2.arrowedLine` (thickness=2, tip length=0.3) and store annotated frames.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc3_4_'></a>[**Generate & Display Animation**](#toc0_)\n",
    "   - Define an `update` function for the animation: clear the plot, display the current annotated frame (BGR→RGB), add a title showing frame number and speed legend.  \n",
    "   - Create the animation with `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation` (match the original video’s FPS for playback speed, enable `blit=True` and `repeat=True`).  \n",
    "   - Display the animation in Jupyter (using `IPython.display.HTML`) and save it as `Video/Wingsuit_Analysis.mp4` (use `libx264` codec for compatibility).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc3_5_'></a>[**Acknowledgment**](#toc0_)\n",
    "   Add a markdown cell stating the video source:  \n",
